## 🚀 Quick Start

Get started in minutes with a fully containerized, AI-optimized environment.

1. **Generate your app:**

   ```bash
   npx create-powerflow-app my-app
   ```

   > Alternative package managers:
   >
   > ```bash
   > # pnpm
   > pnpm create powerflow-app my-app
   >
   > # yarn
   > yarn create powerflow-app my-app
   > ```

2. **Open your new project in [Cursor](https://cursor.com) (recommended) or [VS Code](https://code.visualstudio.com)**

3. **Reopen in Container** when prompted (DevContainer)

4. **Start developing!**

> For the full AI pair programming experience, use Cursor with the pre-configured rules. In VS Code, Cursor rules are not available, but you can use other AI tools.

For advanced setup, see [Development Environment](docs/development.md).

## 🤖 AI Pair Programming Workflow

Vite PowerFlow enables seamless collaboration between human developers and AI assistants through:

- **Project Planning**: Generate development prompts using our [Development Plan Generator](workflows/DEVELOPMENT_PLAN_GENERATOR.md), which provides:
  - A clear contract between humans and AI agents
  - Well-defined phases and milestones for tracking progress
- **Cursor Integration**: Optimized workflow with pre-configured rules in the [Cursor directory](.cursor) for enhanced collaboration

For detailed information about the AI pair programming workflow, see [AI Pair Programming](docs/ai-pair-programming.md).
