## Code Standards
- Functional React components with hooks
- Strict TypeScript typing
- Explicit names for functions and variables
- Meaningful tests (Given-When-Then pattern)
- Comments only when necessary to clarify complex logic
- Feature-based architecture rather than technical type

## Architecture Principles
- Adapt architecture to project requirements rather than forcing specific technologies
- Follow domain-driven design where appropriate
- Maintain clear separation of concerns (UI, business logic, data access)
- Prioritize modularity and reusability of components
- Ensure consistent patterns within each architectural layer
- Document architecture decisions and their rationales
- Consider scalability, performance, and maintainability in all design choices
