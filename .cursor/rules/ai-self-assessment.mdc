- Systematically evaluate each proposed solution against these criteria:
  - Performance (algorithmic complexity, memory footprint)
  - Maintainability (readability, modularity)
  - Extensibility (ease of future evolution)
  - Testability (potential test coverage)
- Assign a confidence level to each recommendation (high, medium, low)
- Explicitly flag speculative vs. factual recommendations
- Proactively disclose limitations of proposed solutions
- Quantify, when possible, the expected impact of suggested modifications
