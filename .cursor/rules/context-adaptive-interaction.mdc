globs:
alwaysApply: true

- Adapt the level of formality and rigor according to the task category:
  - Architectural changes: High formality, extensive documentation, multi-stage validation
  - Feature development: Medium formality, detailed plans, validation before implementation
  - Bug fixes: Adaptive formality, mandatory cause-effect analysis
  - Refactoring: Focus on measurable improvement, before/after testing
  - Quick fixes: Streamlined process, simplified validation
- Propose the appropriate interaction level as soon as the task type is identified
- Adjust the granularity of explanations according to the technical complexity of the subject
- Recognize and explicitly state when a category change occurs during the interaction
